# Immunization Strategy

There are many different strategies for immunizing populations in order to
prevent transmission of a virus or an infectious disease with a minimal number
of doses.  One such strategy, outlined in [1], is to fragment a population into
separate groups via a "separator". This strategy partitions a population into
two large groups of similar size and a third group that serves as the
separator. The separator is chosen so that all connections between the two
larger groups pass through it, and should be kept as small as possible. In this
scenario, removing the separator  from the population disconnects the two large
groups, preventing transmission of the infection between the groups. Immunizing
the separator then breaks the transmission cycle, and so selecting a separator
that contains as few individuals as possible will minimize the number of
immunization doses required. In this example, we show how this optimization
problem can be implemented using the Ocean SDK and solved using the hybrid
discrete or constrained quadratic model solvers available in Leap.

## Usage

To run the demo, type:

```python demo.py```

Additional options are available to select different graphs to run the problem
on. To see the full list of options, type:

```python demo.py -h```

During a successful run of the program, two images are produced and saved. The
first is the original input graph, saved as `input_graph.png`.

The second highlights the partition of the population into large groups (left
and right) and separator (center).

### Graphs Available

Several different types of graphs or networks are available for this demo using
the options provided. These are all built using NetworkX graph generator
functions, and the details of these functions can be found
[here](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable//reference/generators.html#).

- `karate`: Karate Club graph; a fixed graph on 34 nodes.
- `internet`: Internet Autonomous System network; specify number of nodes 
  between 1,000 and 5,000.
- `rand-reg`: A random d-regular graph; specify number of nodes and value for d.
- `ER`: Erdos-Renyi random graph; specify number of nodes and edge probability.
- `SF`: Barabasi-Albert scale-free graph; specify number of nodes and number of
  edges to add from a new node to any existing nodes.

The default graph is the internet graph on 1,000 nodes. The largest number of 
nodes allowed for any graph specified can be at most 5,000.

## Code Overview

Given a population represented as a graph, the optimization problem can be
broken down into the following objective and constraints.

- Objective: Minimize the number of nodes in the separator
- Constraint 1: Large groups have equal size
- Constraint 2: No edges between the large groups

This problem can be modeled as a discrete quadratic model (DQM) or a 
constrained quadratic model (CQM). We assign a variable for each node in the 
graph, and each variable has three cases: one for each large group and one for 
the separator group. A variable can be assigned to exactly one of those three 
groups.
